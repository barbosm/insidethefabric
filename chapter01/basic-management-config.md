# Basic Management Configuration

First let's do some generic but very important management configuration.

> #### info::CLI Structure
>
> You'll most likely notice that the FortiOS \(the operating system that runs on FortiGates\) is a little different from let's say [VyOS](https://vyos.io/) or a Cisco Switch where you can configure things in one line, instead in FOS you need to enter or 'get in' the relevant config section, so the config will be nested inside that specific section. A good way to explore the options inside that section is to simply type '**tree**' which will give you all options inside that section or simply type **'?'** after a part of the command, it will give the options to complete the current command.

## Change admin password

```
config system admin
    edit "admin"
        set password verygoodandsecurepassword
    next
end
```

## Hostname

```
config system global
    set hostname FG
end
```

## Admin session timeout

```
config system global
    set admintimeout 60
end
```

## Update firmware

> #### warning::Firmware Upgrade Procedure
>
> Always follow the [upgrade path](http://cookbook.fortinet.com/sysadmins-notebook/supported-upgrade-paths-fortios/) and read the release notes of the target version before updating the firmware.

First check your current version:

```
FG # get sys stat
Version: FortiGate-VM64 v5.4.2,build1100,161101 (GA)
...
```

Now you can choose the target version, download it from the FortiGuard servers and update your device.

```
FG # exec restore image management-station ?

## Check licensing and security updates

After the update you can check the FortiGate entitlement \(which security services it has activated and have support, essentially this dictates if you can update AV, IPS, AC \(Application Control\) definitions.
