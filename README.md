# Insider's Guide to Fortinet Security Fabric

Information Security has never been more relevant than now and the difference between a boring and stable environment and a exploited one sometimes can be just a few knobs turned in the right way.

This book aims to give you the knowledge to turn those right knobs using the Fortinet Security Fabric technology, it's important to consider this as a living book and as technology, attack methods and defenses evolve we should evolve together.

## What I assume you already know ?

To fully enjoy the contents of this book is expected from the reader a basic knowledge of networking \(ip addressing, basic routing protocols\), operating systems and protocols \(like http, dns\). This book will be straight to the point most of the times, but it's not supposed to be complex.

## What is the goal of this book ?

To give you enough knowledge to design, build and operate a medium-size network considering a range of security solutions and technologies like firewalls, load balancers and VPNs. In the end, this book is intended for everyone who use Fortinet solutions, in this book the following solutions are covered:

| Solution | Version |
| :--- | :--- |
| FortiGate | 5.6 |
| FortiAnalyzer | 5.6 |
| FortiManager | 5.6 |

## Some conventions

I usually prefer to give instructions using the CLI commands as they're easier to follow and are less subjected to updates in the GUI, in this book first version I'll use that as my main method to configure.
